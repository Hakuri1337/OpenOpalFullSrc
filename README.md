# OpenOpal

OpenOpal is a free and open-source Fabric client mod for Minecraft 1.21.10.
It is based on Opal v2 and focuses on maintaining a usable modern client with
combat, movement, utility, visual, and world modules adapted for the current
codebase.

## Status

The project currently builds with:

- Minecraft 1.21.10
- Fabric Loader 0.19.2
- Fabric Loom 1.14.6

Recent work includes updates around KillAura, FakeAB, AntiKB/Velocity handling,
AutoBucket, ChestStealer, InventoryMove, FastWeb, AntiTNT, TargetStrafe,
NoSlow NoC0F, Scaffold-related utilities, ClickGUI behavior, configuration
loading, and MainPage Visuals.

## Building

Install JDK 21, then run:

```powershell

```
